**🔹 3. Themes, Action Style, and World-Building**


**Themes:**
**Grief and Love:** John’s violent rampage isn’t about the car or the puppy—it’s about losing the last piece of his wife.
**Revenge \& Justice:** The film explores consequences of arrogance and disrespect.
**Code of Honor:** Assassins live by strict rules (like no killing on Continental grounds).



**Action Style:**
**Gun-fu:** A blend of martial arts and close-range gunfights.
**Clean choreography:** Long takes, wide shots, minimal shaky-cam — letting the audience feel every move.
**Stylized violence:** Brutal yet elegant.



**World-Building:**
**The Continental Hotel:** A neutral ground for assassins, introducing an underground world with its own rules, gold coin currency, and honor system.
**The Myth of John Wick:** He’s more than a man — a legend feared even by crime lords.gi
