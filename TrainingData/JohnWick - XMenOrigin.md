X-Men is a 2000 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. 

Directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by David Hayter and a story by Singer and Tom DeSanto, it features an ensemble cast consisting of Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ray Park, and Anna Paquin. 

The film depicts a world where an unknown proportion of people are mutants, possessing superhuman powers that make them distrusted by normal humans.

It focuses on mutants Wolverine and Rogue as they are brought into a conflict between two groups with radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutant-kind: Charles Xavier's X-Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto.

X Marks the Spot
After early encounters with Magneto and a harrowing fight with the Shadow King, Charles Xavier realized that evil mutants were a threat to humanity and their own kind alike. Charles dedicated his life to promoting peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans by opening Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters.

X-Men, Charles Xavier origin
One of the rechristened Professor X’s first pupils was Jean Grey, a young girl whose telepathic abilities developed far too quickly for her mind to handle.

Xavier subsequently recruited Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, and Angel before formally introducing them to Jean, whom he renamed Marvel Girl. Soon after, Magneto made his public debut by striking at Cape Citadel and seizing control of the military base. Upon hearing the news, Xavier sent the X-Men to confront Magneto and deescalate the military’s response. Despite their inexperience, the young X-Men managed to force Magneto into retreat.

The original X-Men remained together for years, adding a few new heroes along the way. The team doubled in size following an incident on the living island of Krakoa, as mutants from around the world answered Xavier’s call for help. The X-Men have continued to expand, with multiple teams dedicated to keeping Xavier’s vision alive. Their mentor’s dream has often seemed just out of reach, but it remains the driving force behind the X-Men.
